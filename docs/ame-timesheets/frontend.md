# Frontend (React + Vite) – Under Construction

Welcome to the frontend documentation for the AME Timesheets platform.

This frontend client is built using **React** with **Vite** and provides the user interface for all timesheet-related tasks, including:

- Admin login and authentication
- Timesheet dashboard and task inputs
- PDF previews and digital signature flow
- API integration with the Django backend
- Deployment using Docker and AWS EC2

---

## Work in Progress

This documentation page is still under development. We're working to include:

- Component structure and file organization
- API hooks and request patterns (Axios, fetch, etc.)
- How environment variables affect runtime config
- User flow diagrams and page logic explanations
- Styling conventions and UI libraries used
- Troubleshooting build and deployment issues

---

## Want to Help?

If you’re familiar with the frontend codebase and want to help document:

- How the login/auth system is wired
- What each page/component is responsible for
- Best practices for contributing or debugging locally

…then please open a PR or reach out in the internal dev channel. You can edit this page directly at:
