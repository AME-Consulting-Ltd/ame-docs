# Backend (Django API) – Under Construction

Welcome to the backend documentation for the AME Timesheets platform.

This backend service is built using Django REST Framework, and powers all timesheet-related features, including:

- Authentication and authorization
- Timesheet creation and approval flow
- Project, client, and user management
- AWS-integrated file storage and signature processing
- EC2 + PostgreSQL + S3 deployment pipeline

---

## Work in Progress

This documentation page is still under development. We're working to include:

- Endpoint descriptions with sample requests and responses
- Models and relationships (ERD / ORM breakdown)
- Authentication flow (token management, session rules)
- How environment variables power runtime config
- Integration details with S3 and Signature API
- Test strategy, fixtures, and CI/CD validation steps

---

## Want to Help?

If you’re familiar with the backend codebase and want to help document:

- How views and serializers are structured
- Gotchas for onboarding new developers
- Admin setup or how the approval logic works

…then please open a PR or reach out in the internal dev channel. You can edit this page directly at:
